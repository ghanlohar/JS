1. The important keyword
2. Inline styles Example: <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">.
3. IDs - such as #navbar.
4. Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes - This category includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.
5. Elements and pseudo-elements - This category includes element names and pseudo-elements, such as h1, div, :before and :after.
